# Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. 
# [One .txt file] has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and [the other .txt file] has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

# [One .txt file] - http://www.practicepython.org/assets/primenumbers.txt
# [the other .txt file] - http://www.practicepython.org/assets/happynumbers.txt

# (If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. 
# And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)

# Solution (with for loop):

primeslist = []
with open('primenumbers.txt') as primesfile:
	line = primesfile.readline()
	while line:
		primeslist.append(int(line))
		line = primesfile.readline()

happieslist = []
with open('happynumbers.txt') as happiesfile:
	line = happiesfile.readline()
	while line:
		happieslist.append(int(line))
		line = happiesfile.readline()

overlaplist = []
for elem in primeslist:
	if elem in happieslist:
		overlaplist.append(elem)
		
print(overlaplist)

# Solution (with functions using list comprehensions):
def filetolistofints(filename):
	list_to_return = []
	with open(filename) as f:
		line = f.readline()
		while line:
			list_to_return.append(int(line))
			line = f.readline()
	return list_to_return

primeslist = filetolistofints('primenumbers.txt')
happieslist = filetolistofints('happynumbers.txt')

overlaplist = [elem for elem in primeslist if elem in happieslist]
print(overlaplist)
