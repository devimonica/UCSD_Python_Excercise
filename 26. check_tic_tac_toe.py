# This exercise is Part 2 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 3, and Part 4.

# As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board. However, 
# this is significantly more than half an hour of coding, so we’re doing it in pieces.

# Today, we will simply focus on checking whether someone has WON a game of Tic Tac Toe, 
# not worrying about how the moves were made.

# If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:

# game = [[1, 2, 0],
# 	[2, 1, 0],
# 	[2, 1, 1]]

# where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in that space, 
# and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.
