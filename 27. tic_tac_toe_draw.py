# This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.

# In a previous exercise we explored the idea of using a list of lists as a “data structure” to store information about a tic tac toe game. 
# In a tic tac toe game, the “game server” needs to know where the Xs and Os are in the board, to know whether player 1 or player 2 (or whoever is X and O won).
