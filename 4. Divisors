Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

Solution:

number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
numbers_list = range(1, number+1)
new_list = []
for numbers in numbers_list:
    if int(number) % numbers == 0:
        new_list.append(numbers)
print(new_list)
